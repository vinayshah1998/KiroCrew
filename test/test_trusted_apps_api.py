"""Tests for the per-app third-party trust-grant REST API.

Covers the 4 endpoints in ``dashboard/handlers/security.py`` that write
``agent.apps_trusted`` / ``agent.apps_allow_third_party`` in ``config.json``,
plus the end-to-end property that actually matters: a grant flips
``apps.execution.app_execution_denied`` for THAT app and leaves every other
third-party app denied.

The aiohttp handlers are exercised through an in-test ``TestClient`` opened with
``async with`` (matching ``test_denied_commands_api.py``) rather than an
async-gen fixture: the CI-pinned ``pytest-asyncio==0.20.3`` is incompatible with
the pinned ``pytest==8.4.1`` for async fixtures, so the whole suite avoids
``@pytest_asyncio.fixture`` by convention.
