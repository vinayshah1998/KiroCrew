/**
 * The two rules that keep an instance switch from churning windows.
 *
 * Both are the SAME class of bug the tri-state `mochiEnabledState` was created for
 * ("Tearing down on a failed probe is what made the pet appear to crash every few
 * seconds"), reappearing one layer down:
 *
 *  1. KEEP vs FALLBACK — a NON-answer must change nothing. Falling back to self on
 *     a timeout flips the resolved target, and a flipped target destroys and
 *     rebuilds every Mochi window — then does it again when the link recovers. One
 *     slow tick would cost the user their chat panel twice.
 *  2. IDENTITY, not origin — local ports are recycled, so two different instances
 *     can present the same `localhost:<port>`. Comparing origins alone reads that
 *     as "no change".
 *
 * main.js cannot be imported (it boots Electron), so the decisions are mirrored
 * here and a source guard asserts the real code still makes them.
