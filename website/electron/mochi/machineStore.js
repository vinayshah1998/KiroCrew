/**
 * machineStore.js — Mochi's PER-MACHINE preferences, owned by the shell.
 *
 * Two settings are properties of this computer rather than of any one gateway:
 * `petInstance` (whose Mochi the single on-screen pet shows) and the global
 * accelerators (one keyboard). Both used to live in the Mochi app's own settings
 * on the host gateway, and that placement caused three separate defects:
 *
 *  1. THE ONE-WAY DOOR. All four Mochi windows load FROM the gateway they show
 *     (see pageUrl.js), and the renderer's API seam is same-origin. So once the
 *     pet was moved to a remote, the switcher inside it wrote `petInstance` to
 *     the REMOTE while the shell kept reading the HOST — the write landed
 *     somewhere nothing reads, the UI read back its own write and looked
 *     successful, and there was no surface left that could move the pet back.
 *  2. THE POINTER DIED WITH THE APP. `/api/apps/mochi/settings` is behind
 *     `_require_enabled`, so disabling Mochi on the host made the pointer
 *     unreadable — which is why disabling it removed a pet that was showing a
 *     remote whose own Mochi was still on and still serving it perfectly.
 *  3. IT DID NOT SURVIVE A RESTART for the same reason.
 *
 * Holding them here fixes all three at once: the shell can always read them, and
 * there is exactly one copy no matter which gateway serves the window.
 *
 * PURE FUNCTIONS over an injected store, matching host-config.js — the store is
 * an electron-store instance in production, and a plain Map-like object in tests,
 * so none of this logic needs Electron to be exercised.
