/**
 * i18n lint, deliberately a SECOND eslint invocation rather than rules added to
 * `eslint.config.js`.
 *
 * `no-literal-string` at `mode: 'all'` reports on the order of a thousand findings
 * on this codebase. Folding those into the main config would push them into the
 * same `--max-warnings 1116` budget that guards `no-explicit-any`, `jsx-a11y` and
 * `no-console` — and an i18n regression would then be indistinguishable from a new
 * `any`. Separate config, separate budget, separate signal.
 *
 * ## Why `mode: 'all'` and not the default
 *
 * The plugin's default is `jsx-text-only`, which sees only plain text in JSX
 * markup. `jsx-only` adds JSX attributes. Neither sees a literal inside a JSX
 * *expression container* — `{cond ? 'Generating…' : 'Download Export (.zip)'}` —
 * and that is where the largest class of untranslated strings in this dashboard
 * lives, including the export and import buttons on the Portability tab.
 *
 * Template literals are a separate opt-in again: `should-validate-template` is
 * required on top of `all`, or `` `Show ${n} more app${n === 1 ? '' : 's'}` ``
 * stays invisible.
 *
 * The cost of `all` is false positives, so the noise is controlled by the
 * `include`/`exclude` regexes below rather than by weakening the mode — a narrower
 * mode does not report fewer false positives, it reports fewer findings of every
 * kind, including the ones that matter.
