/** True when a WS chat frame is a REDELIVERY of a row the transcript already
 *  holds, so applying it again would render the same message twice — or, in the
 *  `assistant` branch, overwrite a live stream with stale text.
 *
 *  Identity is the server-minted row id `meta.mid` (`_ChatSlot.append`), and
 *  nothing else. The backend stamps it once per row and every door the row can
 *  arrive through carries it: the slot-detail HTTP rebuild, the live
 *  `chat_message` broadcast, and the JSONL round trip (persisted with `meta`,
 *  restored with it), so the two copies of one row are recognisably one row.
 *
 *  What this replaces, and why: a (`ts`, role, content) tuple cannot express
 *  this. A coarse OS clock stamps two rows appended in the same tick identically
 *  (the collision `mergePreservedClientTs` pass 1 already guards against) and two
 *  byte-identical messages are legitimate — a Slack channel window can replay
 *  exactly that pair. So a tuple either misses a redelivery (a duplicate bubble)
 *  or matches two distinct rows (a message silently disappears), and no tuning
 *  removes the ambiguity. An explicit id does.
 *
 *  A frame with NO `mid` is never treated as a duplicate: rows a client mints
 *  locally (streaming, thinking, optimistic bubbles) have no server identity yet,
 *  and channel-replayed rows genuinely carry no `meta` at all (`ConversationLog`
 *  writes only role/content/ts/source_* for those). Declining to dedup renders a
 *  duplicate at worst; guessing would drop a real message.
 *
 *  Called from ONE chokepoint per path, placed so it dominates every branch that
 *  creates OR mutates a row — the `tool` insert, the `assistant` reconcile (which
 *  overwrites the trailing `streaming` row, so a late redelivery of an old frame
 *  would clobber a NEW segment's live content), the `user` echo reconcile, and
 *  the generic push. A guard sitting after any of those is a guard some frame
 *  slips past.

 *  window is likewise often absent — kiro-cli reports a percentage far more
 *  often than absolute token counts — in which case no token entry is written
 *  at all and the meter keeps using its model-derived window.
 *
 *  Seeds ONLY when the slot has no entry yet. The backend broadcasts over WS
