/**
 * `api` — the ONLY seam between the vendored original Mochi renderer
 * (`src/renderer/`, `src/shared/`) and this builtin.
 *
 * Every original renderer file reached the outside world through one handle:
 *
 *     const api = (window as any).mochi
 *
 * Each copied file replaces exactly that ONE line with `import { api } from
 * '../mochiApi'`. That keeps the components structurally identical to upstream
 * (so `git diff` against the pristine copy stays readable when KiroCrew's Mochi
 * lands here) while fixing three things the global handle got wrong:
 *
 *  1. It was `any`, so a missing method compiled fine and was then swallowed by
 *     the `?.` at the call site — the exact "renders correctly, does nothing"
 *     failure mode this migration kept producing. `api` is typed, so a wrong or
 *     absent method is a `tsc` error.
 *  2. The handle was captured at MODULE EVALUATION time, so any adapter that
 *     installed itself onto `window` had to run before the first component
 *     import. A plain import has no such ordering hazard.
 *  3. The Electron preload ALSO defines `window.mochi` (window management,
 *     click-through, menus). Merging on the global made the winner depend on
 *     load order; here the merge is explicit and greppable.
 *
 * Deliberately ABSENT (team sync decisions + architecture). The originals guard
 * every call with `?.`, so an absent method is a no-op rather than a throw — but
 * the corresponding UI is REMOVED rather than left dead:
 *   - self-updater: mochiCheckUpdate, mochiReinstall, devTestUpdate,
 *     devForceUpdateUI, devReinstall — KiroCrew owns updates.
 *   - backend switching / tunnel: tunnelConnect, tunnelStatus, onTunnelStatus,
 *     onBackendSwitching, onBackendSwitchError, onBackendResolved — the builtin
 *     is same-origin, so there is no backend to repoint.
 *   - soul: getSoul, setSoul — each avatar carries its own persona.
 *   - themes: broadcastTheme — Mochi follows the KiroCrew theme.
 *   - dictation: sendDictationTranscript, cancelDictation, onDictationState,
 *     onDictationStopRecording — push-to-talk is not ported.
 *   - onHide: DEAD UPSTREAM — the original's preload exposed it but nothing in
 *     its main process ever sent `pet:hide`.
 *   - `send` / `invoke`: a generic IPC relay is on the preload's never-expose
 *     list; exposing it would hand page content an arbitrary main-process call.
