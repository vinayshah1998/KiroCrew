## Browser Module

Thin auth layer for enterprise-authenticated website browsing via Playwright MCP.

### Architecture

Browser Mode is a durable capability toggle in **Settings → Browser**, not a
per-message chat control. When it is enabled the backend prepends the `[BROWSE]`
marker to each chat message so the agent operates the browser; when it is off no
marker is injected and the agent falls back to read-only `web_fetch`.

```
Browser Mode ON  → backend injects [BROWSE] on every message → agent operates
  the browser → Playwright MCP tools: browser_navigate, browser_click,
  browser_snapshot, etc.

Browser Mode OFF → no [BROWSE] marker → agent uses read-only web_fetch instead
```

Browsing is default-on for every turn while Browser Mode is enabled. A client MAY
send an explicit `browse: false` to suppress it for a single turn, but there is no
standing per-session "Globe" toggle.

### Two Modes

Two independent choices in **Settings → Browser** decide how a page opens: the
transport (attach to your own browser vs. let Playwright launch its own) and, for
the launch path, which engine Playwright launches.

| Mode | Platform | How it works |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Extension (attach)** | macOS (recommended) | Playwright attaches to the user's running **Chromium-family** browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, Opera) through the "Playwright MCP Bridge" extension. All existing auth (enterprise SSO session, Sentry, Kerberos) works automatically. Chromium-family only: Playwright ships no attach extension for Firefox or Safari, so those cannot be attached. |
| **Launch (headless)** | Linux Cloud Desktops, macOS fallback | Playwright launches its **own** browser build. The launch engine is one of `chromium` / `firefox` / `webkit` (default `chromium`), selected in Settings and persisted in the `browser-engine` file. `firefox` and `webkit` are Playwright's own patched builds, not the user's installed Firefox/Safari, so they carry no user logins. Chromium adds `--auth-server-allowlist` + storage-state cookie injection. |

### Key Design Decisions

**Delegate browsing to Playwright MCP** — we don't implement click/fill/navigate/screenshot.
Playwright MCP handles all browser interaction. KiroCrew only handles enterprise-SSO auth.

**Two auth strategies:**
- Extension mode: zero auth work — real Chrome session has everything
- Headless mode: storage state (`~/.kiro/crew/playwright-storage-state.json`) + Kerberos via `--auth-server-allowlist`

**Install on Browser-Mode enable.** Turning Browser Mode on from Settings runs a
real install: `ensure_playwright_installed(engine)` in `browser/setup.py`
bootstraps Node when absent (through the bundled `ensure-node.sh`), runs
`npm install -g @playwright/mcp@latest`, then `playwright install <engine>` to
fetch the OS/arch browser binary for the selected launch engine. It is
best-effort and never raises: it returns a structured
`{ok, step, detail, engine}` so the Browser settings save handler reports
progress or an actionable failure in its JSON body instead of 500-ing. The npm
and browser steps are skipped when a launcher already resolves, so re-enabling is
fast.

**Browser Mode is a persistent capability toggle.** The durable
`browser-mode-enabled` flag file under the data home is the gate. While it is on,
the backend injects the `[BROWSE]` marker on every message. While it is off, the
agent uses read-only `web_fetch` instead.

### Auth Flow (Headless Mode)

1. `kirocrew browse auth health` — validates SSO cookie, Kerberos ticket, AEA posture
2. `kirocrew browse auth refresh` — converts `~/.kiro/crew/browser-cookies.txt` → `~/.kiro/crew/playwright-storage-state.json`
3. Playwright loads cookies from storage state at context creation (no manual injection)
4. `--auth-server-allowlist=*.example.com` handles SPNEGO challenges (the OSS build ships no enterprise allowlist)
5. For SSO-gated sites: `kirocrew browse auth federate <url>` completes the federated login SPNEGO chain via curl

### Auth Flow (Extension Mode)

1. User has Chrome open with existing auth (enterprise SSO session, Sentry extension)
2. Playwright MCP connects via extension token (`PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTENSION_TOKEN`)
3. All navigation uses the real authenticated session — no cookie injection needed

### Config Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.kiro/crew/playwright-config.json` | Playwright MCP config: `--auth-server-allowlist`, `storageState`, `isolated: true`, capabilities |
| `~/.kiro/crew/playwright-storage-state.json` | Playwright storage state (generated from `~/.kiro/crew/browser-cookies.txt`) |
| `~/.kiro/crew/browser-mode-enabled` | Flag file: Browser Mode enabled (durable capability toggle; presence = on) |
| `~/.kiro/crew/browser-engine` | Selected launch engine (`chromium` / `firefox` / `webkit`); absent or unrecognized reads back as `chromium` |
| `~/.kiro/crew/playwright-extension-mode` | Flag file: extension (attach) mode enabled |
| `~/.kiro/crew/playwright-extension-token` | Chrome extension connection token (0o600 perms) |
| `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` | MCP server config (args: `--extension` or `--config`) |

### Source Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `browser/auth.py` | SSO cookies, federated SSO, KRB5CCNAME, health checks, URL validation |
| `browser/setup.py` | Browser Mode + engine flags, `ensure_playwright_installed` (Node bootstrap + `@playwright/mcp` + `playwright install <engine>`), config generation, storage state refresh, MCP config patching |
| `browser/cli.py` | `kirocrew browse` CLI: setup, auth health/refresh/inject/federate, extension on/off |
| `mcp_playwright_proxy.py` | Stdio proxy: intercepts Playwright MCP responses, compresses accessibility trees |
| `skills/browser-auth/SKILL.md` | Agent skill for auth + Playwright MCP workflow |
| `scripts/refresh-playwright-cookies.py` | Standalone script: `~/.kiro/crew/browser-cookies.txt` → storage state |
| `config/playwright-mcp-config.json.template` | Template for the Playwright config structure |

### Context Window Optimization (Playwright Proxy)

Playwright MCP's `browser_snapshot` returns full accessibility trees (50-100K tokens on heavy pages). The **Playwright proxy** (`kirocrew mcp-playwright-proxy`) intercepts these responses and auto-compresses them before they reach the LLM — the full tree never enters context.

**How it works:**
- kiro-cli → `kirocrew mcp-playwright-proxy` (stdio) → real `npm-playwright-mcp` (subprocess)
- Proxy forwards all messages bidirectionally
- Intercepts responses with accessibility trees (>5K chars with tree-like structure)
- Compresses to compact outline: only interactive elements (links, buttons, inputs, headings, images) with refs
- ~95% token reduction on heavy pages

**Registration (one canonical server, no duplicates):** kiro-cli splits an agent
`@server` reference on `/`, so a slash-containing key like `@playwright/mcp` is
mis-parsed as `@server/tool` and exposes none of the server's tools. The proxy is
therefore always registered under the **slash-free canonical alias**
`playwright-mcp` (`mcp_server_alias("@playwright/mcp")`), and every writer drops
the superseded keys it historically used so exactly one Playwright entry survives:

- `kirocrew setup` — new installs get the canonical proxy entry from the start.
- `patch_mcp_extension()` / `patch_mcp_headless()` — write the entry under the
  canonical alias, after `_drop_superseded_playwright()` removes any legacy proxy
  key (`@playwright/mcp`, `playwright-proxy-mcp`) **and** KiroCrew's legacy
  *direct* `npm:@playwright/mcp` entry (that `npm:`-prefixed key is a KiroCrew
  install artifact; a user's own direct server under the bare `@playwright/mcp`
  key is left untouched — authorship is by launch target, not key name).
- Gateway startup — `_migrate_playwright_to_proxy()` delegates to
  `migrate_owned_playwright_registration()`, which converges KiroCrew's own
  browse entry in `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` to the canonical key — including
  upgrading a legacy *direct* `npm:@playwright/mcp` entry (from installs predating
  the compression proxy) to the proxy — converges KiroCrew's own
  `~/.kiro/crew/mcp.json` at the SOURCE (so a stale proxy key there is healed once,
  not re-injected into every rebuild), and sweeps the KiroCrew-generated agent
  configs (the exact `kirocrew*` filenames it writes, not a bare `*.json` glob, so
  a user's own agents are never rewritten) so a duplicate proxy entry collapses
  onto the one canonical server. This self-heals an existing machine on a plain
  restart.
- Every agent-config rebuild — `converge_playwright_servers()` runs right after
  key normalization in `build_agent_config` as a BACKSTOP (the owned source files
  are healed at boot above; this catches anything re-merged mid-rebuild),
  collapsing any Playwright-proxy entry by *resolved launch target* (an entry that
  invokes `mcp-playwright-proxy`). This catches a slash-free legacy key (e.g.
  `playwright-proxy-mcp`) that key normalization — which only rewrites
  slash-containing keys — cannot fold. Convergence keeps the canonical key
  (unless a user's own *direct*, non-proxy server already occupies it — then the
  proxy is left under its own non-conflicting key rather than clobbering the user
  entry), rewrites dropped `@refs` in `tools`/`allowedTools`, and never touches a
  user-declared, non-proxy server. Together with discovery read-folding and pool
  launch-target dedupe, all surfaces agree on the single `playwright-mcp` server,
  so no second backend, dashboard row, or probe is derived.

**Ownership signals (authorship of an MCP entry).** `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` is
co-owned with kiro-cli, and kiro-cli validates it (and agent specs) with
`deny_unknown_fields`, so an in-spec ownership sentinel is impossible. KiroCrew
therefore records the MCP keys it writes in an out-of-band sidecar manifest
`~/.kiro/crew/owned-mcp-keys.json` (`_record_owned_mcp_key`, mode 0600), written by
`patch_mcp_extension()` / `patch_mcp_headless()`. Drop/converge decisions consult
this manifest **first** (`_load_owned_mcp_keys`); the `mcp-playwright-proxy`
launch-target heuristic (`_spec_is_proxy`) and the `npm:@playwright/mcp` legacy-key
rule remain the fallback for entries written by installs that predate the
manifest. This stops the unmarked-entry population from growing so future
migrations rely less on forensic heuristics on a destructive, every-restart path.
*Follow-up:* extend the manifest to the agent-config writers and to all
drop/converge sites (currently the sidecar sweep still keys on the owned-filename
allowlist + launch target), and consider consolidating the per-surface
convergence passes behind one canonicalizing `mcp_utils` accessor.

### Live Browse Mirror

The dashboard mirrors the headless `[BROWSE]` Chromium in near-real-time **without
opening any debug port on the browser**. The headless Chromium runs on the gateway
host; the only window onto it from a laptop is the dashboard (reachable over the
reverse SSH tunnel).

**Relay path.** The Playwright proxy already intercepts every
`browser_take_screenshot` response and re-encodes it to JPEG. It additionally
re-POSTs that already-captured frame to the gateway's loopback
`POST /api/browser/frame`, which rebroadcasts it over the existing WS as a
`browser_frame` event; the `BrowserLiveView` panel renders the latest frame. This
rides Playwright's existing authenticated, pipe-based control channel — it
deliberately does **not** add a `--remote-debugging-port`. An earlier revision
attached to a CDP debug port for smoother frames; that port was an unauthenticated,
full-control endpoint on an authenticated browser session (a net-new
local-process-takeover surface), so it was dropped.

**Frame validation (`build_frame_payload`).** A pure helper normalizes the POSTed
body into the `browser_frame` payload so the framing contract is unit-testable:
- `data` must match the base64 charset (`_B64_RE`) — this structurally excludes
  `:` (no `://` URL), whitespace, and `<`/`>` (no HTML/script), which is the right
  boundary control for browser-captured image bytes; no text redaction is applied.
- `format` must be in the `{jpeg, png, webp}` allowlist; `svg` is deliberately
  excluded because an SVG data URI can carry executable script (XSS safety).
- `session_key` is passed through only if it matches a bounded safe charset
  (`_SESSION_KEY_RE`, ≤128 chars) so the WS payload can't carry arbitrary text.

**Active pump.** Frames from agent screenshots alone are sparse, so the proxy runs
a background active pump that injects its own idle-gated `browser_take_screenshot`
into the Playwright subprocess to keep the mirror current between agent shots
(~1-3 fps). It is single-in-flight (with a timeout so a hung browser can't wedge
it), demuxes the proxy-namespaced response id (`__mc_pump_` prefix — never
forwarded to kiro or written to disk), and backs off when there are zero
subscribers (learned from the frame endpoint's response subscriber count). It is
disabled in extension mode (the user already sees their own Chrome) and gated on
recent real browse activity.

**Pump audit.** The proxy is a stdlib-only stdio subprocess and cannot reach
`sel.py`, so each pump injection is reported to loopback
`POST /api/browser/pump-audit` and the gateway emits the SEL
`browser_take_screenshot` tool-invocation audit event on the proxy's behalf,
keeping proxy-internal tool calls auditable.

**Panel.** The live mirror renders in the floating `BrowserLiveView` window — a
lifecycle-driven, resizable, persisted overlay that auto-opens in the corner on
the first frame of a browse session (minimize→chip, close→dismiss-this-session).
It consumes the frame stream via `useBrowserFrame` and is threaded with the
resolved session *title* (the raw `session_key` is only a client-side lookup key
against the dashboard's own slot store). It is read-only — no interactive
control channel.

> Note: the chat side panel's **"Web Preview"** tab (`WebPreviewPanel`, opened
> from the + menu) is a SEPARATE feature — a URL-addressable iframe that
> live-previews a local dev server the user is running (per-session URL), NOT
> this agent-browse screenshot mirror. It does not consume the `browser_frame`
> stream. The URL bar has back/forward (a URL-bar history stack — an iframe's
> own cross-origin page history isn't readable), an inline reload, an
> open-in-browser link inside the field, and an **expand** toggle: expand
> broadcasts `PREVIEW_FOCUS_EVENT`, on which App collapses the left nav and
> ChatPage hides the session list + maximizes the side panel (chat shrinks to its
> minimum). A **dimension selector** (Monitor icon = responsive desktop;
> Smartphone icon = a device size — iPhone/Pixel/Galaxy/iPad presets) renders the
> iframe at that device's pixel size. A **crop** button (shown only where the
> snip pipeline works — `isScreenSnipSupported()`, non-mobile) dispatches
> `PREVIEW_SNIP_EVENT`; ChatPage handles it by reusing the shared snip pipeline
> (`captureScreen` via getDisplayMedia — routed through Electron's
> `setDisplayMediaRequestHandler` in the desktop app — → `SnipOverlay` drag-crop →
> `uploadFiles` attaches the PNG to the composer, pinned to the slot that
> initiated the capture so a mid-capture slot switch can't misfile it).
>
> **Liveness.** A cross-origin iframe keeps displaying its last document after
> its server dies, so while a URL is framed the panel polls it (`fetch` no-cors,
> tab-active only); two consecutive connection failures ⇒ the iframe is unmounted
> and a "server not reachable" state shown instead of the stale page, and a later
> successful probe auto-restores it.
>
> **Security.** The iframe is loopback-only (http(s), mixed-content-guarded). Cookies
> are scoped by host but not port, so `isolatePreviewHost` swaps a preview whose
> host equals the dashboard's (both loopback) to the other loopback alias
> (`localhost` ⇄ `127.0.0.1`) — the dashboard's host-scoped auth cookie is never
> sent to the framed dev server. The dashboard CSP admits loopback `frame-src`
> unconditionally (`_LOOPBACK_FRAME_SRC` in `server.py`), so previews render in the
> packaged app, not only in instances mode.

**Fallback tools** in kirocrew-core (for manual use if needed):

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `browse_outline` | Compress snapshot text → compact outline with refs |
| `browse_search` | Regex search snapshot text → matching lines only |

### Dashboard Integration

- **Settings → Browser** panel: turn Browser Mode on/off (the durable capability
  toggle), pick the launch engine (`chromium` / `firefox` / `webkit`), toggle
  extension (attach) mode, and paste the extension token. Enabling Browser Mode
  triggers the Playwright install and re-registers the proxy.
- **Backend** prepends the `[BROWSE]` marker to each message while Browser Mode is
  enabled; browsing is default-on with no per-message chat toggle.
- **BrowserAuthPrompt** component: notification banner when an auth gate is detected
- **API endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/browser/config`: read `enabled`, `engine`, `engines`, `installed`,
    `extension_mode`, and `token` status
  - `PUT /api/browser/config`: save `enabled`, `engine`, `extension_mode`, and
    `token`. On a fresh enable this downloads `@playwright/mcp` + the engine
    browser off the event loop and re-registers the proxy; a failed install
    reports an actionable `code` in the body rather than 500-ing
  - `POST /api/browser-auth-retry` — retry auth (calls `ensure()`)
  - `POST /api/browser-event` — broadcast browser activity events via WebSocket
  - `POST /api/browser/frame` — ingest a browse screenshot, rebroadcast as `browser_frame` WS event, return live subscriber count (loopback-only, in `internal_paths`)
  - `POST /api/browser/pump-audit` — SEL audit for proxy active-pump screenshot injections (loopback-only, in `internal_paths`)

### Security

| Control | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| URL validation | `federated_login()` (stubbed enterprise SSO flow) restricts to `*.example.com` placeholders; the OSS build ships no enterprise allowlist |
| Token storage | Written with `os.open(..., 0o600)` — not world-readable |
| SEL audit | All browser API endpoints emit SEL audit events |
| `browser_evaluate` | NOT auto-approved — requires user confirmation (cookie exfiltration risk) |
| Storage state | Written with `0o600` permissions via `os.open` |

### Platform Matrix

Extension (attach) mode is Chromium-family only. The launch (headless) path lets
the operator pick the engine (`chromium` / `firefox` / `webkit`, default
`chromium`); `firefox` and `webkit` are Playwright's own builds, not the user's
installed Firefox or Safari.

| Platform | Mode | Auth | Browser |
|----------|------|------|---------|
| macOS | Extension (attach, recommended) | Real browser session | User's Chromium-family browser (Chrome/Edge/Brave/Arc/Opera) via extension |
| macOS | Launch (fallback) | Storage state + SPNEGO | Playwright's own `chromium`/`firefox`/`webkit` build |
| AL2/AL2023 x86_64 | Launch (headless) | Storage state + SPNEGO | Playwright's own `chromium`/`firefox`/`webkit` build |
| AL2/AL2023 NICE DCV | Extension (attach, opt-in) | Real browser session | User's Chromium-family browser via extension |
| AL2 aarch64 (glibc 2.26) | Fallback | N/A | read-only `web_fetch` only |

### Credential Lifetimes

| Credential | Lifetime | Refresh | MCP Restart? |
|---|---|---|---|
| SSO session cookie | ~20 hours | your SSO login + `kirocrew browse auth refresh` + `browser_set_storage_state` | No |
| Kerberos TGT | ~6 hours | your Kerberos login | Yes (read at Chromium launch) |
| Extension token | Permanent (until Chrome extension reinstalled) | Re-copy from extension popup | Yes |

### Proof-of-Possession Enforcement (Future)

Cookie replay will stop working when SSO proof-of-possession is enforced.
- **Extension mode:** unaffected — real Chrome has the AEA extension
- **Headless mode:** will break — fall back to `ReadInternalWebsites` or switch to extension mode
