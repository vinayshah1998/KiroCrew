"""The one request-free way to stop an app's code.

Two callers need to make an app's code stop running: ``POST /api/apps/{name}/disable``
and revoking that app's third-party execution grant. Before this module the revoke
path carried a hand-maintained copy of the disable handler's sequence, and a copy is
a defect with a delay on it: any step added to the handler later would silently not
run on revoke, recreating the "revoke reported success while the backend kept
executing" bug that shipped in the first draft of the grant feature.

So the sequence lives here once, and it deliberately takes NO aiohttp request. The
disable handler's request-bound tail — notification-channel unregistration, the
builtin module's ``on_disable(app)`` hook, builtin service sync — stays in the
handler: those need ``request.app``, and none of them are what makes third-party
code stop. What does is here, in order:

1. ``on_app_disable`` — Python shutdown hooks, route deregistration, cron cleanup.
2. ``stop_app_backend`` — the backend PROCESS. Skipping this is what let a revoked
   app keep running with its app secret and its routes still proxied.
3. ``deregister_app`` — agents, skills, MCP servers.

Ordering matters: hooks first (the app gets to shut down cleanly), then the process,
then the registrations, so nothing re-registers behind us.

Both blocking steps are offloaded to the subprocess executor — ``stop_app_backend``
signals a process group and waits, ``deregister_app`` walks and rewrites registry
files — because this runs on the gateway's event loop, where a slow filesystem would
stall every other request and the heartbeat.

    ``failures`` is the load-bearing field: a caller that must not claim success
    (revoking trust) checks it, while a caller that proceeds regardless (the
    disable handler, whose contract is "disable proceeds anyway with warnings")
    can surface everything and continue.

    The split exists because ``on_app_disable`` reports cron cleanup as PROSE in a
    single field — ``"removed 3 job(s)"`` on success and ``"failed: cron store busy
    — jobs may still be enabled"`` on failure. Treating both as a warning is how a
    contended cron store could leave an app's scheduled commands armed while the
    revoke endpoint returned 200 and reported the app switched off: the same
    "reported success while third-party code kept running" defect this module was
    extracted to kill, one layer up.

    Never raises for a failing step: a teardown that aborts halfway leaves the app
    in a worse state than one that pushes through and reports. Each failure is
    logged, collected into ``failures``, and the next step still runs — stopping the
    backend matters even when a shutdown hook threw.

    ``record`` is the app's installed metadata (``manager.get_app``) and is passed
    straight to the app's own shutdown hooks. Hooks and the backend stop run for
    every app unconditionally; the ONE step that varies is bridge deregistration,
    and ``withdrawing_trust`` is what selects between two genuinely different jobs:

    * ``False`` — an ordinary **disable** (a lifecycle operation). The app's
      ``resources`` field is honored: ``"app"`` means the app registered its own
      agents, skills, crons and MCP servers and owns their lifecycle, so the
      gateway must not delete them. ``deregister_app`` removes by app-name prefix
      without asking who created an entry, so calling it here would destroy
      app-owned state on a routine off-switch.
    * ``True`` — **trust withdrawal** (a security operation: revoke, or the blanket
      falling-edge sweep). Deregistration is unconditional, because ``resources``
      is a field of the app's own ``installed.json`` — writable by any app trusted
      to run code — so honoring it here would hand the app a switch for evading its
      own teardown. The trade is deliberate and only defensible in this direction:
      the operator has withdrawn permission for this app's code to be in the
      runtime at all, so leaving a registered execution surface behind is the worse
      failure, and re-granting trust re-registers it.
