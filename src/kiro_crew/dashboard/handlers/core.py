    * **Startup** — before the socket binds, connection failure is the external
      not-ready signal. After bind, ``DashboardState.ready`` remains false and
      the probe returns 503 while session restoration, channel relaunch, tunnel
      setup, and other startup work finish.
    * **Serving** — the server publishes ``DashboardState.ready = True`` at the
      same final boundary used by the boot-to-ready metric; readiness is then
      200 while required state is wired and shutdown has not been requested.
    * **Shutdown requested** — when SIGTERM/SIGINT or ``POST /api/shutdown``
      sets the process-wide ``shutdown_event``, readiness changes to 503 while
      ``/api/live`` remains 200 until the HTTP server exits. Supervisors that
      poll during this interval can stop routing new work; this endpoint does
      not itself impose or promise a minimum load-balancer drain delay.

    Shutdown takes precedence over subsystem checks. The response carries only
    fixed, low-cardinality booleans/markers — no paths, ids, counts, secrets, or
    user/session content. The probe paths are exempt from the host_validation
    middleware (orchestrators address pods by IP — see origin.PROBE_PATHS), so

    (startup/shutdown/subsystem markers) are therefore gated on ``check_host``,

# ── KiroCrew Config API ──
# The security-relevant ceilings (SUBAGENT_AUTO_MAX_CEILING,
# SUBAGENT_MAX_TURNS_CEILING) are imported from ``config.loader`` — the single
# source of truth shared by this API-write gate and the loader's load-time
# clamp, so the two cannot drift apart. subagent_auto_max is the security cap
# that bounds max_subagents, so it needs its own hard upper bound to stop a
# caller raising it arbitrarily (e.g. {"subagent_auto_max": 9999}) to bypass
# the concurrency limit.

# Agent settings whose ENFORCED effect is fixed at gateway startup.
# ``SubagentManager`` is constructed with ``max_subagents`` and
# ``subagent_max_turns`` and never re-reads the config afterwards;
# ``max_concurrent`` is stored once with no setter, and ``subagent_auto_max``
# only reaches that enforced value as the ``hard_cap`` inside
# ``compute_max_subagents``, which the same construction calls.
#
# Precisely: persisting one of these does NOT change what the running gateway
# ENFORCES. It is not inert, though — the advisory cap advertised to the model
# re-resolves from config on each read, so after a write the reported cap can
# move while the enforced one stays put. That divergence is pre-existing and
# deliberate (overflow queues, so the advertised number is guidance rather than
# a limit); this constant describes only the enforced side, which is what the
# restart is for.
#
# ``dynamic-subagent-sizing.md`` states the contract this mirrors: "The cap is
# computed once per gateway start. Restart to recompute." The ``restart_required``
# response field is the existing convention for exactly this case — the channel
# config handlers already return it for settings read at boot, and the frontend
# API client already types it.
#
# ``conductor_skill`` is deliberately absent: it is applied inline by this
# handler (the skill file is regenerated/removed in-request), so it takes effect
# immediately and must not raise the restart hint.
