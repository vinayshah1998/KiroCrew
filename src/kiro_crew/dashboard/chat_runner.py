    production code). One histogram powers both turn latency and fault rate.

    ``duration_ms`` is the provider-reported duration and ``elapsed_ms`` the

    A still-zero duration skips the emit deliberately: an absent sample reads
    as "no data" on the Telemetry page, whereas a recorded 0 would render as a
    plausible-looking 0ms p50 — the very symptom this guard's misuse caused.

    Caveat on what the wall clock measures: ``elapsed_ms`` runs from the start
    of the turn, so a turn parked on an interactive tool-approval prompt counts
    the operator's thinking time as turn duration. There is no finer-grained
    source on the acp path (the provider reports nothing at all), so this is

    maps it back to the canonical key ONLY for ``claude_code`` (the canonical-
    keyed dropdown); for kiro/acp it is a no-op so a kiro dotted id that happens

    kiro-profile guard: on the kiro/acp path ``canonicalize_for_provider`` is a
    no-op, so a backfilled value is stored into ``slot.model`` verbatim and

    ``global.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8[1m]``) — not the alias the user picked —
    so backfilling it pins the slot to one profile + region. A session that once
    resolved to the 1M Opus profile then stays nailed to it across resumes even
    when that profile is capacity-throttled, and the picker can no longer
    dislodge the poisoned value (observed: every "model unavailable" throttle hit

    awareness). So for non-``claude_code`` providers we DROP a profile-form id
