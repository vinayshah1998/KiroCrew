    ``read_text()``) and the cron count comes from a direct read-only parse of
    ``crons.json`` (``count_enabled_from_disk``). The WS status pusher runs on
    the event loop, so computing these inline would stall the loop — and with
    it EVERY other WebSocket / coroutine on the gateway — for the duration of
    that disk latency (seconds on a slow/large home dir or a contended NFS
    mount). Offload both to a worker thread so the loop stays responsive; the
    pusher is a periodic background task, so the extra thread hop is free.

    NOTE: this deliberately uses ``count_enabled_from_disk`` rather than
    ``list_jobs``. ``list_jobs`` calls ``_sync()`` → ``_load()`` → ``_arm_timer()``,
    and ``_arm_timer`` calls ``asyncio.create_task`` — with no running loop in a
    worker thread that raises ``RuntimeError``, and since ``_arm_timer`` cancels
    the existing timer first it would silently stop all scheduled cron jobs.
    ``count_enabled_from_disk`` is a pure read that never mutates loop-owned
    state or the timer, so it is safe off-thread.
