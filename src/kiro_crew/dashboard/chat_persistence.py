            #
            # `meta.tool_input` carries the large tool payloads, so meta is where the
            # boot cost actually lives — and its 31 readers are tractable: outside the
            # emit sites (which redact and are covered by
            # test_display_time_redaction.py) every one reads only CONTROL fields

            # `content` is the opposite on both axes: it is cheap (0.4s) and it has

    Same contract and return values as the synchronous form, including
    returning ``None`` for a session the user closed with ✕.

    Why split rather than simply wrapping the whole thing in
    ``asyncio.to_thread``: slot construction is loop-affine. It reaches
    ``get_or_create_slot`` → ``push_slots_update`` → ``_broadcast``, which uses
    ``asyncio.Queue.put_nowait`` and ``Event.set`` — neither thread-safe — and
    ``_spawn_ws_send``'s ``ensure_future`` raises off-loop. That raise lands in
    a broad ``except`` that marks every connected dashboard client dead and
    drops it *without a close frame*, so browsers never reconnect and stop
    receiving frames until a manual reload. ``restore_open_slots_async``
    documents the same invariant.

    So only the two reads move: the metadata line and the chained message walk,
    which on a large session are tens of MB of read plus JSON parse. Everything
    that touches slot state runs on the loop, as the synchronous callers do.

    """Return ``(frozen_prefix, foreign_lines, dedup_dropped)`` for a save.

    ``frozen_prefix`` is the verbatim bytes of the first *disk_older* on-disk
    message lines — the turns OLDER than the in-memory window. They are never
    rewritten, so older history survives a restart that only loaded a recent
    window. The bytes are cached on the slot keyed by ``(mtime, size,
    disk_older)`` so a steady 5s flush is O(window) rather than O(file size).

    ``foreign_lines`` are on-disk message lines in the WINDOW region (the bytes
    after the frozen prefix) that this slot's in-memory *window_entries* do NOT
    represent — i.e. acknowledged appends made by ANOTHER process (subagent /
    cron / CLI) that this slot never saw. ``_save_slot_to_history`` captures its
    ``window`` snapshot BEFORE taking ``_locked``, so a cross-process writer can
    fully append + release between the snapshot and this save acquiring the lock;
    a bare ``meta + frozen + window`` replace would then silently delete that
    acknowledged message. Carrying these lines into the payload makes the save
    non-destructive against cross-process appends. A
    disk line is treated as ours (dropped; the window re-serializes it) when its
    ``ts`` matches a window entry (covers in-place edits, which keep ``ts`` but
    change content) OR — as a COUNT-BOUNDED tiebreak — its ``(role, content)``
    matches an as-yet-unconsumed window entry (covers a same-process
    ``append_if_absent`` copy persisted with a FRESH ``ts`` distinct from the
    window entry's in-memory ``ts``). The tiebreak is bounded so each window
    entry absorbs AT MOST ONE disk copy: if the on-disk window region holds two
    lines with identical ``(role, content)`` but distinct timestamps — the
    window's own persisted copy PLUS a genuinely distinct event from another
    process (e.g. a repeated identical cron / workflow result) — only the first
    is folded into the window and the second is preserved as a foreign append.
    A plain ``(role, content)`` set collapsed those two real events into one;
    the bounded, timestamp-first identity
    fixes it. Timestamp is the closest thing to a stable per-message id today;
    the intended successor is a creation-time per-message uuid that demotes this
    heuristic to a legacy fallback for un-stamped lines (see also
    ``docs/system-specs/modules/history.md``). ``dedup_dropped`` returns any
    fresh-``ts`` content-tiebreak drops so the caller can route them through the
    archive — even the residual ambiguous case (a distinct message
    indistinguishable from an ``append_if_absent`` copy without a stable id)
    then loses no data permanently.

    Fast path: when BOTH the on-disk mtime AND size match the frozen-prefix
    cache, THIS slot was the last writer and nothing has landed since, so the
    prefix is served from cache and the foreign lines preserved by the previous
    save are re-emitted verbatim from cache — the O(file) read/scan runs ONLY
    when the file changed on disk since our last write. Size is part of the key
    because an append always grows the file even inside a single coarse mtime
    tick, so mtime alone is not a safe change signal for a data-loss guard.
    Re-emitting the cached foreign lines (rather than assuming there are none)
    is what makes the fast path non-destructive: a previous save may have
    preserved a cross-process append INTO the on-disk window region, and since
    ``disk_older`` is unchanged those preserved lines would otherwise be dropped
    by a bare frozen-prefix + in-memory-window rebuild on the very next save.

    Returns ``("", [])`` when the file is missing/unreadable/has no metadata line.

    The session file is modeled as **frozen prefix + live window**:

    - The **frozen prefix** is the first ``slot._disk_older_count`` on-disk
      message lines — the turns OLDER than the in-memory window (set at
      restore/resume). These bytes are read verbatim and NEVER rewritten, so a
      restart that loaded only a recent window can no longer destroy older
      history.
    - The **live window** is ``slot.messages`` (small, ~500 messages). It is
      re-serialized in full on every save. Re-serializing the whole window means
      in-place edits to already-shown messages (stop-event resolution, file-change
      chips, mcp_oauth banner completion) and any reordering done by
      ``_flush_segment`` all persist correctly — there is no position counter to
      get out of sync.

    The default save writes ``meta + frozen_prefix + serialize(window)``.

    Pass ``rewrite=True`` (or an explicit *messages* snapshot, which implies it)
    for operations that INTENTIONALLY truncate the window (rewind/regenerate/
    fork): the file is rebuilt as ``meta + frozen_prefix + serialize(snapshot)``
    and the dropped window tail is archived first via ``_archive_dropped_lines``.

    Concurrency: ``_flush_dirty_slots`` runs this in an executor thread
    while ``_run_chat`` mutates ``slot.messages`` on the event loop. We snapshot
    ``list(slot.messages)`` (a single GIL-atomic attribute read) and the matching
    ``slot._disk_older_count`` up front, then operate only on that snapshot, so a
    concurrent ``_flush_segment`` reassigning ``slot.messages`` cannot interleave
    with the read-serialize-write and skip/duplicate a message.

    Operates ONLY on this slot's own single session file (``_path(history_key)``);
    tab_id chaining is 1:1 (a slot's tab_id maps to exactly one file — fork makes
    a fresh slot with its own file), so this never reads/writes a sibling and
    legacy no-tab_id sessions stay isolated.

    :func:`_save_slot_to_history` holds the per-session cross-process
    ``_locked`` across its read-modify-``atomic_write``. That lock, invoked on
    the gateway event loop, makes a single
    non-blocking acquire and raises :class:`~kiro_crew.history.HistoryLockTimeout`
    under any concurrent holder (e.g. a workflow/cron result appending via
    :func:`~kiro_crew.history.append_off_loop`) — so calling the save inline on
    the loop would both risk a disk write on the loop and drop the save under
    benign contention, or surface the timeout into the aiohttp handler.

    This helper mirrors :func:`~kiro_crew.history.append_off_loop`: on a running
    loop it dispatches the save to a worker thread so it takes the *patient*
    off-loop acquire path; off the loop it saves inline.

    ``best_effort`` (default ``True``): a lock timeout / I/O error is logged and
    the slot is marked ``_dirty`` so the periodic flush retries the write — the
    in-memory slot is the source of truth. This retry re-arm matters for the
    metadata mutation endpoints (pin / folder / tag / mode), which call this with
    ``force=True`` but do not otherwise mark the slot dirty: without it a
    swallowed failure would drop an acknowledged edit with no retry, losing it
    after a restart. Pass ``best_effort=False`` for archival paths (session
    close/cleanup) that must CONFIRM the durable write succeeded before removing
    the session: the save still runs off-loop (patient acquire), but any
    exception propagates so the caller can roll back and keep the slot.
