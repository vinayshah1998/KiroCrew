"""Per-app WebSocket event scope enforcement.

App tokens connected to /api/ws must only receive events they are authorised to
see, based on the ``permissions.events`` declarations in their ``app.json``.


## Event tiers

Tier 0 — always delivered to every connected client (no sensitive payload):
    ``dashboard``  — gateway status snapshot (version, cron count, etc.)

Tier 1 — slot-scoped: delivered only when the calling app is allowed to see the
    slot that the event belongs to.  All events carrying a ``slot`` field fall into
    this tier.  Visibility is controlled by the ``slots:*`` and ``subagent:*``
    declarations in ``permissions.events`` (see below).

Tier 2 — global events with no ``slot`` field.  An app must explicitly list the
    event name (or a wildcard scope) in ``permissions.events`` to receive it.

## Slot visibility scopes (``slots:*``)

Declaration             Slots visible
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(default / slots:own)   Only slots where owner_app == self
slots:user              All slots where origin == SlotOrigin.USER
slots:app:<name>        Slots owned by ``<name>`` — requires ``<name>`` to
                        declare this app in its ``exposeToApps`` list
slots:all               All slots (broad -- see the note on self-declaration below)

The same scope also controls which slot-scoped subagent events are visible.
The ``subagent:*`` declarations are an independent, additive dimension:

Declaration             Subagent events visible (overrides slots:* for subagent events)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(default / subagent)    Own slots only (same as slots:own)
subagent:user           Subagents in user-initiated slots
subagent:app:<name>     Subagents in <name>'s slots (requires exposeToApps opt-in)
subagent:all            All subagent events (broad)

## Global event declarations (``permissions.events``)

notification            Own app's notifications (source_app == self) only.
                        Foreign and system-sourced notifications still denied.
notification:system     Gateway-internal pushes with no source_app -- cron
                        results, send_message, watchlist output. Separate from
                        ``notification`` because that stream is user content
                        rather than the app's own: bundling them would make
                        one declaration a broad grant, the very shape this
                        module exists to remove.
notification_ack / notification_unack carry only a timestamp, so they cannot be
attributed to a source at all and need `notification:all`.
notification_channel_settings IS attributable -- its channel is `<app>.<id>` or
`system.<kind>` -- so own-channel settings ride `notification`, system channels
ride `notification:system`, and foreign channels need `notification:all`.
notification:all        All notifications regardless of source (broad).
sessions                sessions_restarting
yolo                    yolo_expired
artifacts               artifact_update ({slug, version, deleted}; metadata only)
workflow_run_event      Declared by its own literal name -- already the correct
                        per-event Tier 2 shape, and the only events declaration
                        present in the tree today (the workflows app).
log                     Gateway log stream (broad)
browser                 browser_event (broad)

## Scope declarations are SELF-declared

Every scope above is read from the app's own ``app.json``. Nothing in this module
consults an install-time approval, so an app can widen itself by writing
``slots:all`` into its manifest -- which is consistent with the trust model
(installing an app already grants it in-process gateway privilege) but means the
tiers are a *structuring* mechanism plus an audit trail, not a barrier against a
hostile manifest. The one asymmetric check is ``exposeToApps``: cross-app
visibility requires consent from the app being observed, because there the
manifest being trusted is not the one being widened.

Gating the broad scopes through the install-time consent path
(``apps/admission.py``) is tracked separately.

## Dashboard users (empty app claim) are unaffected — full event stream as before.
