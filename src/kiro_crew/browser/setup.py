    Runs on gateway init. The Playwright proxy must be registered under the

    the gateway does not derive a second pooled backend). Two KiroCrew-owned
    surfaces are converged, keyed by *resolved launch target* (an entry that
    invokes ``mcp-playwright-proxy``) plus KiroCrew's superseded keys:

    1. kiro's ``~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`` — the browse entry KiroCrew
       co-manages — is rewritten to the canonical proxy entry. This also upgrades
       KiroCrew's legacy DIRECT ``npm:@playwright/mcp`` entry (written by installs
       that predate the compression proxy) to the proxy, preserving the original
       boot migration's direct-to-proxy behavior.
    2. KiroCrew's own ``~/.kiro/crew/mcp.json`` — the agent-specific MCP override
       merged into the agent config on every rebuild — is converged at the
       SOURCE, so a stale ``playwright-proxy-mcp`` key there is healed once rather
       than re-injected on every rebuild for the per-rebuild
       :func:`converge_playwright_servers` backstop to undo indefinitely.
    3. The KiroCrew-generated agent configs (the exact filenames in
       ``_OWNED_KIRO_AGENT_FILES`` / ``_OWNED_CC_AGENT_FILES``) are swept so any
       duplicate proxy entry (e.g. a legacy ``playwright-proxy-mcp``) collapses
       into the single canonical ``playwright-mcp``. This self-heals an existing
       machine on a plain gateway restart, without waiting for a full agent
       rebuild. Only the exact files KiroCrew writes are touched — a user's own
       custom agents in the same dirs are never rewritten.

    Never adds Playwright where none exists, never rewrites a user-declared
    server, and never mutates the user-owned discovery sources
    (``~/.claude.json``) — those converge for *display* on read (discovery
    canonicalization) and at launch (pool dedupe), not by mutating files.

    When Browser Mode is OFF, this instead REMOVES the proxy from every Kiro Crew
    surface: registration is the authorization, so a stale proxy left by a prior
    enable (or a pre-upgrade install) must not survive a restart into a mounted
    ``browser_*`` tool set while the durable toggle is off.
