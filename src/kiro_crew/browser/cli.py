    logins. Requires the Playwright Extension (one Chrome Web Store listing
    covers the whole family):

  Headless mode (default on Linux): Playwright launches its own browser. The
    engine (chromium/firefox/webkit) is chosen in Settings → Browser; firefox
    and webkit are Playwright's own builds, not your installed Firefox/Safari.
