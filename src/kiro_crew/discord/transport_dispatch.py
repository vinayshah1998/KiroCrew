"""Full new-path dispatch: DiscordTransport -> TurnDriver -> DiscordRenderer.

``DiscordTransport.receive()`` authorizes + normalizes an inbound message and
hands the ``InboundMessage`` to :meth:`DiscordDispatcher.handle_message`,
which mirrors the Telegram transport dispatch:

    command intercept (!new, !compact, !help, …)
    -> construct DiscordRenderer + on_turn_start (typing indicator)
    -> session acquire -> context build
    -> TurnDriver.run(provider, renderer)   # shared redaction + approval ladder
    -> post-turn (record_success, persist, soft-threshold notice)  # each guarded
    -> renderer.close() + session release   # in finally

``on_interaction`` resolves interactive tool approvals (``a:<rid>:<1|0>`` ->
``DiscordApprovalDecider.resolve_global``) and re-injects ``[OPTIONS:]``
choices (``opt:<i>``) as fresh turns.

Dependency direction is ``discord -> messaging`` (allowed). The security
``tool_gate`` and spawn auto-approve are wired inline off ``ctx_builder.hooks``
(channel-neutral) so this module never imports ``kiro_crew.slack``.
