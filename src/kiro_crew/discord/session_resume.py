        Disconnect retains the binding and its inbound marker, so a reply here
        still resolves to *key*. Without this, that reply reached the session and
        the answer was swallowed by the outbound gate: the conversation looked dead
        while silently consuming input, and the dashboard answered someone who was
        typing in Discord. Slack has always lifted its pause on a thread reply
        (``slack.handler._resume_if_paused``); this is the same rule for channels,
        so a user who learns one is not wrong about the other.

        Deliberately no history re-seed: the user is reading this conversation
        right now, so replaying it here would be noise. Explicit dashboard
        Connect is the path that catches up.

        MUST be called only AFTER the inbound governance gate has permitted the
        message — resuming persists, so doing it earlier would leave a denied
        channel connected.

        The read is an in-memory lookup and stays inline; the WRITE is offloaded
        with ``asyncio.to_thread`` because ``set_mirror_paused`` calls ``_save``,
        which serialises the whole session map — on slow storage that would stall
        the event loop on a path that runs for every reply. Guarded on the READ so
        the write happens once, on the mute→live transition, and never on a reply
        to a live binding. ``is True`` because a stubbed SessionManager returns a
        truthy Mock, which would otherwise "resume" a binding never muted.
