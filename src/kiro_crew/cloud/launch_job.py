"""Durable, non-interactive launch jobs for the cloud launcher in the dashboard.

The CLI wizard (:mod:`cloud.wizard`) is stdin-interactive and streams progress to
the terminal. The dashboard needs the *same* provisioning flow as a **background
job** whose progress — including the device-code sign-in prompt — is structured
state persisted to disk. That lets the UI render it, lets the user navigate away
and come back, and lets it survive a gateway restart (the on-disk state is the
source of truth).

This module owns three things and deliberately NOTHING else (no HTTP — that is
``handlers_cloud.py`` in the next stage — and no ``ui.*`` terminal printing):

* the job state model — :class:`LaunchJob`, :class:`LaunchStep`,
  :class:`SigninPrompt`, and the status/step-state constants;
* :class:`LaunchJobStore`, a disk-backed store (one JSON file per job, atomic
  writes, ``KIROCREW_HOME``-aware via ``config_dir()``);
* :func:`run_launch`, the orchestrator that drives the tested ``cloud/`` engine
  through the steps and persists state after every transition.

The engine is injected (:class:`LaunchEngine`) so the orchestration is unit
tested against a fake — no AWS calls in tests.
