"""Session manager — maps Slack thread_ts to LLM provider sessions.

Each Slack thread gets its own LLMProvider instance. Sessions are
cleaned up after idle timeout (default 30 min).

Warm session pool: ``start_pool()`` pre-spawns kiro-cli processes so
``get_or_create()`` returns instantly.  After handing out a warm session,
a replacement is created in the background to maintain the target count.

Background session: ``BACKGROUND_KEY`` is a persistent shared session for
lightweight background work (cron, heartbeat, lesson extraction).  It
stays alive between uses, serialized by the per-session semaphore.

At >= ``cfg.session.autocompact_pct`` context usage, fires a background
compaction task. Both backends compact **in place** so the session — and
any queued or agentic work on it — continues without a user nudge:

* **kiro-cli:** run ``/compact`` in place under the session semaphore
  (native command execute + ``_kiro.dev/compaction/status`` wait). The
  process and session ID survive; the conversation is summarized in
  place. If the in-place compact fails or times out, fall back to the
  legacy **recycle**: kill the session and let the next user message
  re-seed context via ``build_session_context()`` (the session_map entry
  is dropped to avoid false-resume from stale state). A recycle is never
  forced through a live turn — if the turn semaphore cannot be acquired,
  the attempt is skipped and re-triggered at the next turn end.
* **claude-agent-acp:** run ``/compact`` in place under the session
  semaphore. The SDK preserves the same session ID across the
  compact_boundary; the session keeps its summary and continues without
  a recycle.

A failed compact records a per-key cooldown so a broken /compact does
not fire on every subsequent turn. The compact callback fires on both
success and failure; the dashboard uses ``success`` to choose the
banner copy. The user's response is never blocked — compaction is
fire-and-forget.

Circuit breaker: after 5 consecutive failures on a session, the session
is force-reset instead of retrying forever.

Per-session semaphore: serializes prompts on the same session key so
concurrent Slack messages on the same thread don't interleave.

Process Sweep Architecture
--------------------------
Four mechanisms clean up processes. They are complementary — not redundant.

1. ``cleanup_orphaned_sessions()`` — **startup + shutdown only**.
   Reads ``kiro_session_pids.txt`` (bare sandbox root PIDs from the previous
   gateway run). Validates each with ``_is_managed_agent_process``, kills descendants
   bottom-up, then kills the root. Truncates the file afterward.
   *Cannot be replaced by the periodic sweep* because sandbox roots are
   independent processes with no idle timeout — they survive indefinitely
   unless explicitly killed.

2. ``_cleanup_orphaned_mcp_servers()`` — **periodic** (every ~5 min).
   Reads ``kiro_pids.txt`` (child:parent pairs). Kills children whose parent
   is confirmed dead. PPid-based reuse guard prevents killing recycled PIDs.
   Also prunes dead bare PIDs. *Depends on (1)* — children are only orphaned
   after their sandbox root is killed.

3. ``_expire_idle()`` — **periodic** (every ~5 min).
   Kills sessions idle for >``timeout_secs`` (default 30 min) via
   ``reset()`` → ``provider.shutdown()`` → SIGKILL process tree.
   Protected keys: ``_PERSISTENT_KEYS`` (``_bg`` and ``_hb``).
   **Known limitation**: ``last_used`` is only bumped on ``get_or_create()``,
   not on every LLM round-trip. A task runner step doing continuous work for
   >30 min without a new ``get_or_create()`` call could be swept. This is
   accepted for now to prevent runaway tasks, but may need a heartbeat or
   persistent-key mechanism if longer steps become common.

        Closes the lease-dispatch race (Codex HIGH). A caller obtains a session
        and its per-session semaphore *lease* from :meth:`get_or_create`, does
        async prep, then drives ``provider.stream(...)``. The ``_closing`` gate in
        ``get_or_create`` only blocks callers that have NOT yet acquired a lease;
        a caller that took its lease BEFORE ``close_all`` set ``_closing`` can
        still reach dispatch AFTER — and an already-issued lease cannot be
        revoked. Such a turn would first open *after* ``drain_active_turns``'s
        snapshot, be absent from the drain set, and get killed mid-turn with its
        native-session lock held (the empty-response-after-restart bug, #200).

        The caller MUST therefore call ``begin_turn`` **synchronously, with no
        await in between**, immediately before the stream drive. This method only
        *reads* ``_closing`` — atomic in the single-threaded event loop, so no
        lock is needed — and the stream's synchronous prefix clears the native
        turn-done event (registering the turn) before its first ``await`` (see
        ``AcpClient.stream_events``: ``_turn_done.clear()`` precedes
        ``await ensure_ready()``). So the ``_closing`` read here and that turn
        registration form ONE yield-free span; in the event loop that span is
        strictly ordered w.r.t. ``close_all``'s ``_closing`` set — the turn is
        EITHER registered before the drain snapshot (and thus drained) OR the
        caller aborts here. It can never straddle, so no un-drained turn opens
        during the drain window.

        NOTE: making this ``async`` / lock-guarded would REOPEN the race — the
        ``await`` would yield the loop between the check and the turn
        registration, letting ``close_all`` snapshot in between. ``key`` is
        accepted for API symmetry and possible future per-key gating; the
        current shutdown signal is manager-global.

        Raises:
            SessionClosingError: a gateway restart/shutdown is in progress; the
