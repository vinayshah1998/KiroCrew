"""Downscale an image so an agent can read it back without wedging the session.

A provider rejects the ENTIRE request when a many-image conversation carries any
image wider or taller than ``MAX_EDGE_PX``. kiro-cli replays the whole message
history every turn, and the offending block sits at a fixed history index that
nothing can evict — so one oversized read poisons every later turn, not just its
own. Capping is therefore not cosmetic, and the error is asymmetric: downscaling
costs some detail, skipping it costs the rest of the conversation.

This exists as a FILE rather than a shell one-liner in the skill because the
one-liner had a portability hole per platform — GNU-only ``readlink -f`` on
macOS, no ``python3`` on native Windows, and a path containing an apostrophe
breaking an inlined ``p='...'`` literal. Paths arrive as ``argv`` here, so
quoting is the shell's problem and not the snippet's.

Usage:

    python3 downscale_image.py shot.png [more.png ...]

Exit codes: 0 = every path is now within the cap (including ones already
within it), 1 = at least one path could not be processed.
