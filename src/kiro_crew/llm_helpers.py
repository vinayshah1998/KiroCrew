    :func:`save_conversation_turn` makes TWO ``ConversationLog.append`` calls, and
    append acquires a cross-process flock and writes to disk -- ~12 ms each on a
    large transcript. Called directly from an ``async def`` that is worse than
    slow: on a running loop ``_locked`` makes a single NON-blocking acquire and
    raises :class:`~kiro_crew.history.HistoryLockTimeout` on any concurrent
    holder, and most callers swallow that, so the durable copy was dropped
    exactly when another writer was active. Off the loop the same primitive takes
    the patient poll-to-deadline path instead.

    This is the single choke point for every async caller, so the offload cannot
    be forgotten at a new call site and the ten Slack sites do not each restate
    it.

    Unlike :func:`~kiro_crew.history.append_off_loop`, this **awaits** the write
    rather than firing it at the executor and returning. That difference is
    deliberate: callers here go on to refresh a dashboard tab or hand the session
    to consolidation, both of which read the transcript back, so the turn has to
    be on disk before the caller continues. ``append_off_loop`` has no such
    reader and can afford to be fire-and-forget.

    The whole turn is written under one :meth:`~kiro_crew.history.ConversationLog.atomic_appends`
    hold. ``append`` locks per ROW, so without it two concurrent turns for the
    same session could interleave into ``user_A, user_B, assistant_A,
    assistant_B`` -- turns that no longer pair up, which no timestamp ordering can
    repair because each row's ``ts`` is individually correct. On the loop that was
    impossible (a synchronous caller never yields between its two appends), so the
    hazard is introduced BY offloading and has to be closed here rather than
    inherited.
