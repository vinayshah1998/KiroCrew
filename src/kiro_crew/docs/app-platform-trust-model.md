# App Platform Trust Model

Kiro Crew's app platform loads app Python directly into the gateway process
(`apps/module_loader.py` → `importlib` → `exec_module`). This page documents the
resulting trust boundary and how Kiro Crew makes it explicit.

## What an app can do

When you **enable** an app, its backend hooks, route handlers, and lifecycle
scripts run **in-process with full gateway privileges**:

- Arbitrary `import`, filesystem, and network access
- Access to anything in the gateway process's memory (including resolved credentials)
- Manifest `setup` lifecycle scripts run via `/bin/bash -c` (OS-sandbox-wrapped, but
  the script body comes from the app's `app.json`)

The app **permission system** (`permissions.py`, `context.py`, `app.json`
`permissions.mcpTools`) gates only the **SDK tool surface** handed to the app
context. It does **not** restrict imports, filesystem, network, or subprocess use
by the loaded module. There is currently **no process-level sandbox** around app
code itself.

> **Installing/enabling an app is therefore equivalent to running that code with
> the same privileges as Kiro Crew itself.** Only enable apps you trust.

## How Kiro Crew makes the boundary explicit

- **Builtin vs third-party split** — apps shipped inside the package
  (`apps/builtins/`) are trusted like core. Anything loaded from outside that
  directory is treated as third-party.
- **One-time SECURITY warning** — the first time a third-party app's Python is
  executed, `module_loader` logs a loud warning naming the app and the privilege it
  receives.
- **SEL audit** — every module load is recorded in the Security Event Log with its
  trust class (`builtin` / `third_party`), so app-code execution is auditable.
- **Hard off switch** — set `agent.apps_allow_third_party=false` (in
  `~/.kiro/crew/config.json` or the config modal) to refuse running any app whose
  Python lives outside `apps/builtins/`. Both app-**Python** execution paths
  consult the switch: `module_loader` raises `ImportError` before `exec_module`
  (in-process hooks), and `backend._start_app_backend_body` returns `None` before
  `Popen` (the out-of-process app backend), each recording a `denied` SEL entry —
  so untrusted app **Python** never runs, in-process or out. Defaults to `true`
  (apps are operator-installed).

  > **Scope (known gap):** this switch gates only app **Python** (the in-process
  > module loads and the out-of-process backend). It does **not** gate
  > app-authored lifecycle *shell* scripts (`setup.onInstall` / `onEnable` /
  > etc., run via `_run_lifecycle_script` → `/bin/bash -c`). Those still run when
  > the switch is off; they are gated instead by the admission policy
  > (`apps/admission.py`) and OS-sandbox wrapping, not by
  > `apps_allow_third_party`. Disabling the switch is therefore not a substitute
  > for not installing an untrusted app.

### App-token scope confinement (CWE-269)

App tokens (minted via the `X-App-Secret` exchange at `POST /api/apps/<name>/token`)
are **deny-by-default** confined by the dashboard auth middleware
(`token_auth.py` `_enforce_app_scope` / `app_token_path_allowed` / `_app_owns_path` /
`_app_api_allowlist`) to the app's own namespace (`/apps/<name>/*` and
`/api/apps/<name>/*`) plus the API path prefixes the app declares in its manifest
`permissions.api` allowlist. Every other path returns `403`, and the
`/apps/<name>/api` reverse proxy (`apps/routes.py` `handle_app_api_proxy`)
independently re-checks that the caller's token app matches the target app, since
the proxy signs requests with the target app's secret.

### WebSocket event scope (CWE-269)

`/api/ws` is a *third* surface reachable with the same app token, and it is scoped
separately: connecting no longer grants the full event stream. On connect the socket
records the caller's app identity and its manifest `permissions.events` declarations
(`dashboard/ws.py`), and every fan-out is filtered per socket at a single chokepoint
(`DashboardState._send_ws_all` → `_ws_client_allowed` → `dashboard/ws_event_scope.py`).
Both dispatch paths — `broadcast_ws()` and the `_broadcast()` `_type` translation —
funnel through it, as does the subagent-subscriber fan-out.

Events fall into three tiers. Tier 0 (`dashboard`, `refresh`, `update_progress`) carries
no sensitive payload and is always delivered. Tier 1 is slot-scoped: delivery depends on
the slot's `SlotOrigin` and the app's `slots:*` declarations (`slots:own` is the default,
then `slots:user`, `slots:app:<name>`, `slots:all`); `subagent:*` is an independent
dimension so an app can watch subagent status without receiving chat content. Tier 2 is
global and requires an explicit declaration; notifications split further by source, so
`notification` covers the app's own pushes while gateway-internal ones (cron output,
`send_message`, watchlist results) need `notification:system` — bundling them would make
one declaration a broad grant. Cross-app visibility (`slots:app:X`) also
requires the *observed* app to opt in via `permissions.exposeToApps`, so an app cannot
name a sibling unilaterally.

Filtering a frame's payload is not always enough: the `slots` re-push is a full slot list,
so it is re-filtered per app on the send path (`DashboardState._serialize_for_client`) —
but its *envelope* also carries global safety-posture booleans that no slot scope narrows.
`yolo` (is the blanket approval override active) is therefore gated by the same `yolo`
declaration that gates the `yolo_expired` event, and `channelTrusted` is withheld from app
tokens outright — no scope declares it and no app SDK consumer reads it. A withheld field
is *omitted*, never sent as `false`: a falsy default still answers a question the app must
not be able to ask, and answers it wrongly whenever the override is on.

A slot's `SlotOrigin` is declared by the layer that actually knows it, and an undeclared
slot stays untagged. `get_or_create_slot` cannot tell a person typing in the dashboard
from a background injection, so it does not guess: the request layer decides `USER` vs
`APP` from whether a token was presented (`request_slot_origin`), cron declares `CRON`,
and rehydration restores the persisted value rather than re-deriving it. An untagged slot
matches no cross-slot scope, so a caller that forgets to declare loses visibility instead
of leaking — inferring `USER` there put cron output inside `slots:user`.

`permissions.events: ["*"]` predates this vocabulary and still means every event. It is
expanded into the full scope set when the socket's allow-set is built, not carried through
as a literal, because as an opaque member no gate would recognise it and such a manifest
would keep its subscription while receiving nothing.

All other scopes are **self-declared**: they are read from the app's own manifest, with
no install-time approval check. That is consistent with the privilege an installed app
already holds (see above), so the tiers structure and audit what an app receives rather
than defending against a hostile manifest. `exposeToApps` is the one asymmetric case,
because there the manifest being trusted is not the one being widened.

Two payloads need more than a yes/no gate. The `slots` re-push carries every slot, so it
is re-filtered per app in `_serialize_for_client` (failing closed to an empty list); and
the log ring-buffer replay plus the subagent reconnect replay write to the socket
directly, so `ws.py` gates those at the source.

Dashboard-user sockets are exempt, identified by a **positive** `is_dashboard_user`
claim set by the auth middleware — never by the absence of an app claim, which would
fail *open* on any path that forgot to set it. Because the stream is now filtered,
`/api/ws` is implicitly allowed for app tokens (`_APP_TOKEN_IMPLICIT_ALLOW`) rather
than requiring every app to declare the transport; that grant is recorded in the
Security Event Log. `/api/status` is **not** implicitly allowed — it has no
response-level filter to match what event scoping gives `/api/ws`, and it returns
the owner id hash, host specs, cron and usage stats, and the live safety-override
state. An app that needs it declares it in `permissions.api` like any other
capability.

### The frontend `useAppApi` / `useAppEvents` scoping is a guardrail, not a boundary

An app's UI runs **in the dashboard page, with the dashboard user's own authority**. The
SDK's `createScopedApi()` checks the `permissions.api` allowlist *in that same page*
before issuing a same-origin `fetch`, so the request reaches the gateway as a
dashboard-user token (empty app claim) — which `_enforce_app_scope` deliberately never
gates. An embedded app could call `fetch('/api/anything')` directly and succeed. This is
inherent to embedding app UI in the dashboard page, not a defect, but it means the
frontend scoping prevents *accidental* use rather than abuse. The enforceable boundaries
are the app **token** ones above (HTTP paths and WS events), which apply to app-owned
*processes* holding their own credential.

This is an **HTTP-reach boundary distinct from the in-process module-loading
privilege**: an app's loaded Python still runs with full gateway privileges (the
warning above stands), but an app's own HTTP token can no longer reach arbitrary
gateway or sibling-app endpoints. Dashboard-user tokens (empty app claim) are never
subject to this gate.

## Future work

True isolation (running app code in a separate sandboxed subprocess rather than
in-process) is intentionally **out of scope** for now — the open-source app
registry ships empty and all installs are operator-consented. Process isolation
is tracked as a separate design to be revisited if/when a public app store lands.
Until then, operators who install no apps (or run untrusted ones) can set
`agent.apps_allow_third_party=false` to block third-party execution entirely —
both in-process module loads and out-of-process backend spawns. (Corresponds to
CSE finding SEC-012.)
