"""Channel registry: descriptors + the boot/shutdown loops (PR ③ of the RFC).

One registry entry per channel replaces the hand-edited seams that adding a
channel used to require in the host. This module owns the TYPES and the LOOPS
only — it must not import any channel package (``dispatch.py`` pins the
dependency direction: ``<channel> -> messaging``, never the reverse). The one
place that knows every builtin channel is :mod:`kiro_crew.channels`, which sits
ABOVE both this package and the channel packages.

Two views over the same descriptor list, because Slack is deliberately split:

* :func:`governed_members` — ALL channels, including Slack. Governance
  membership (the ``channels`` scope) covers every transport.
* the boot loop (:func:`start_channels`) — only descriptors with a ``start``
  factory. Slack's is ``None`` because it owns its own socket-client lifecycle
  (a governance deny must DROP that client, not merely skip a start call — see
  ``_connect_slack``), so the host starts it separately, after the others,
  preserving today's boot order.

Descriptor honesty rule (learned from the capability truth pass): a field
exists here ONLY if something consumes it in this change. Config schemas,
credential field names for the sandbox denylist, and capability attachment are
REAL parts of the RFC's descriptor design but land with their consumers (the
config-schema PR), not as decorative fields nothing reads.
